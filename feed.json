      "content": "<p>I got interested in deep learning almost a year ago in December 2016. I was searching for something cool for my final year project. This was <em>the</em> thing at that time.</p>\n\n<p>So I started searching for ways to learn as I knew absolutely nothing about ML or Python. The one thing that I found, recommended everywhere was the <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning\">Andrew Ng’s 2008 Coursera course</a>. He’s the founder of Coursera and this was the first course that he put on Coursera (in 2008!!). So I did that course. It has all the basic Math necessary for Machine Learning and is really really important if you wanna know what is going underneath the ML libraries. <em>Highly recommended</em>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"assets/img/ng-coursera.png\" alt=\"Andrew Ng Coursera\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n\n<p>Then I did the <a href=\"https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120\">Intro to ML course</a> by the founder of Udacity, ex-VP of Google: Sebastian Thrun. There you’ll get familiar with Python and a basic ML library: scikit learn. It’s a new age course where they teach you how to get around python libraries (which is a vast corpus). I found it really helpful as it got me straight into python with ML.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, I was also watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A\">Siraj Raval’s videos</a> (I was one of his 20k subscribers) which went straight over my head btw. (That guy is more hype, less knowledge). You don’t get much to learn from him but can get the idea of the scope of the deep learning scene.</p>\n\n<p>While I finished all these things, Siraj mentioned in one of his videos that he was planning a <em>Nanodegree</em>. After a couple of days, I saw a new nano degree on Udacity called “Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation”. I took it immediately. It was 20k Rupees at that time. I did not regret paying that much at that time. But by the time you are reading this, there might be several other deep learning courses on the internet. At the time of this writing, I really like the <a href=\"http://course.fast.ai/\">Fast.ai course</a>. It takes you through the practicality of it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"assets/img/fastai.png\" alt=\"Fast.ai\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n\n<p>Also, one really important youtube courses that helped me a lot was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnWJUyUJYU&amp;list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC\">Andrej Karpathy’s CS231n Winter 2016</a>. He’s one of the pioneers in deep learning. He was a Ph.D. student at Stanford. He has also been the head of Open AI, backed by Elon Musk, and has now moved to Tesla as the self-driving head. A really great guy. His blog is really helpful. Check it out at <a href=\"https://karpathy.github.io/\">this link</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"assets/img/karpathy-blog.png\" alt=\"Karpathy blog\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n\n<p>One more thing that helped me a lot (and is still helping me a lot) is following these people on Twitter. You can get really great information from these pioneers from their twitter accounts. The people I follow on twitter are:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Andrej Karpathy</li>\n  <li>Yann LeCun (Founder of CNNs)</li>\n  <li>Fe Fe Li (Andrej’s mentor)</li>\n  <li>Sebastian Thrun</li>\n  <li>Andrew Ng</li>\n  <li>Soumith Chintala (Head of FAIR, PyTorch)</li>\n  <li>Ian Goodfellow (Founder of GANs)</li>\n  <li>Elon Musk (coz he’s awesome)</li>\n  <li>Demmis Hassabis (Founder of DeepMind, now a part of Google)</li>\n  <li>Google Research</li>\n  <li>Deep Mind</li>\n  <li>Open AI</li>\n  <li>Baidu Research</li>\n  <li>Facebook Artificial Intelligence and Reseach</li>\n  <li>Tensorflow</li>\n  <li>PyTorch</li>\n  <li>Distill publication (The best publication on deep learning)</li>\n  <li>Geoffrey Hinton (if he were there I would follow him)</li>\n  <li>Yoshua Bengio (if he were there I would follow him)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One more place that you can get the first-hand knowledge about what’s happening in the community is the Reddit channel: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/\">/r/MachineLearning</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"assets/img/reddit-ml.png\" alt=\"Reddit ML\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you don’t use twitter or Reddit but use slack, you can use my <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/sdhnshu/shared_invite/enQtMjU0NjM3OTY1NTA1LTMwM2E4NTBjZGRjYjNjMDhkZmY4MzZjOGRkOWNlMmRjZGNkZjIxMzcyOGUxZDkwYjgzNjUyYTg2YTZjZTczYjQ\">slack group: sdhnshu.slack.com</a>. I have channels where you get news from all these guys via twitter and also the most important news from the hot section of /r/MachineLearning. It’s a place to be for all the ML news. I personally use it and you can use it too for all the news in a single place.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"assets/img/slack.png\" alt=\"My slack\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Since then, I’ve been able to implement my own things by reading their papers on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/\">arxiv.org</a>. Also to keep track of all the papers coming in day by day you can use Andrej’s tool: <a href=\"http://arxiv-sanity.com/\">Arxiv Sanity Preserver</a>. It uses ML to sort papers and recommends you relevant papers. Amazing work Andrej.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"assets/img/arxiv-sanity.png\" alt=\"Arxiv sanity\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Hope my journey inspires you to get into deep learning as the more the people are into it, the better.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Like most of you reading this article, I am a newbie to deep learning too. With a basic computer science degree, I entered this arena after I saw so much excitement among the people in this community. And once I knew what it was, I got hooked too.</p>\n\n<p>After Google open-sourced their machine learning library <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZikw5k_2FM\">Tensorflow</a>, there has been a lot of talk about ‘deep learning’ and for those who are <em>not</em> from a technical background, you may wonder what exactly all the hype is about. So without further ado, let’s get into it.</p>\n\n<p>Deep learning is a <em>computer algorithm</em> inspired by the structure of our brains, and neurologists think there’s something similar but a lot more complicated in our brains that help us humans do so complicated things.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1 id=\"a-brief-history\">A brief history</h1>\n\n<p>The algorithms for neural networks were <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/search?q=Frank+Rosenblatt\">invented in the 60’s</a>, but it’s only now that we have enough computation power to carry it out on a large-scale. And our brain has around 1 billion neurons, so we still need a lot of computating power to reach that stage.</p>\n\n<p>Some important people who have worked in this field are <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/search?q=Geoffrey+Hinton\">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Yoshua-Bengio\">Yoshua Bengio</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@karpathy\">Andrej Karpathy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/search?q=Yann+Le+Cunn\">Yann Le Cunn</a>, <a href=\"http://www.andrewng.org/\">Andrew Ng</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/search?q=sebastian+thrun\">Sebastian Thrun</a>, <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Ian-Goodfellow#\">Ian Goodfellow</a>. Be sure to check them out if interested.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1 id=\"so-how-does-it-work\">So how does it work?</h1>\n\n<p>Traditional programming algorithms make us specify every case that can fall upon it. It breaks if an unspecified case occurs. The deep learning algorithm, however, looks at a lot of inputs and their corresponding outputs and tries to learn a pattern between them. Thus, after this <em>training</em> it will be able to predict an output when an unknown input is given. A fun visualization is <a href=\"http://playground.tensorflow.org/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Underneath, there’s a lot of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs&amp;list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU\">matrix multiplications, calculus and statistics.</a> Deep learning is actually an intersection of computer science, data science, neuroscience, and math. We write code that learns by itself and doesn’t need all cases specifically written.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1 id=\"so-does-it-have-neurons-like-our-brains-have\">So does it have neurons like our brains have?</h1>\n\n<p>Yes they do!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"assets/img/perceptron.jpg\" alt=\"Perceptron\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n\n<p>Each circle in this picture is a neuron and there are connections between them. The yellows are inputs and orange is output. Depending on the signal strength of the inputs, the output is decided.</p>\n\n<p>Stack some of them together and you get neural networks that can do different things:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"assets/img/dff.jpg\" alt=\"Feed forward\" />\n<img src=\"assets/img/rnn.jpg\" alt=\"RNNs\" />\n<img src=\"assets/img/cnn.jpg\" alt=\"CNNs\" />\n<img src=\"assets/img/gan.jpg\" alt=\"GANs\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Picture credits: Fjodor van Veen — asimovinstitute.org</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1 id=\"who-should-be-hyped\">Who should be hyped?</h1>\n\n<p>Everyone. Artificial neural networks have broken all records in image recognition and excels in a lot of other fields. Let me give you some examples:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A recurrent neural network defeated the world champion for the 5th time in the hardest game in the world, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUYcTuZJpM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=28s\">Go</a>, in March 2016</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nvidia, Tesla and Google are using convolutional networks for their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhUvQiKec2U\">self driving cars</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google, Netflix, Amazon, and Facebook use neural networks for recommending what movie or product you would like, or whom you would like</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Banks use neural networks for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vOppzHpvTiQ?t=1m33s\">fraud detection</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is the state of the art in voice to text conversion, handwriting recognition and natural language processing</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Art generation app <a href=\"http://prisma-ai.com/\">Prisma</a> uses convolutional neural networks</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Researchers are using it for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BmkA1ZsG2P4?t=6m39s\">drug discovery</a> and for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOWamCtnwTc\">simulating physics</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the godfather of deep learning, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG-dwZMc7Ng\">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, deep learning is going to disrupt a lot of fields in the coming 5 yrs and we can already see it.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1 id=\"theres-also-another-perspective-to-it\">There’s also another perspective to it</h1>\n\n<p>Some people may feel this is not a good thing as this may put us in a situation where machines might overpower us, but a lot of it is very far away and that’s why organizations like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbcRlDBnwjM\">OpenAI, funded by Elon Musk</a> were found that aim to democratize artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>It’s true that artificial intelligence will soon replace our menial jobs and it can’t be stopped. We won’t be driving our vehicles in some years, perhaps we might be able to solve the energy crisis using artificial neural networks.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, a knife can be used for good as well as for bad. Think before you do something, because the possibilities with a synthetic brain are endless. We have again reached a moment in history where we transcend ourselves and take humanity forward. It’s our responsibility to use it wisely.</p>",
