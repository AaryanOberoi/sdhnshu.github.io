This was the fourth project in the Deep learning course where we built a __seq-to-seq__ network in Tensorflow containing an LSTM encoder and an LSTM decoder.

A basic french to english dataset was provided and can be found in the repository. A trained checkpoint with an accuracy of 95% is also linked in the repo.

```
'he saw a old yellow truck.' --(trained network)-> 'il a vu un vieux camion jaune.'
```
