This was my second project in Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation course where we took the *[CIFAR 10 database](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)*, a classic image classification dataset and trained a basic __Convolutional Neural Network__ to classify between the 10 categories specified:
- airplane
- automobile
- bird
- cat
- deer
- dog
- frog
- horse
- ship
- truck

This project was implemented in Tensorflow and no advanced concepts were used, thus we were able to get only around 60% accuracy.
