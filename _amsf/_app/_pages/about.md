I am originally from __Mumbai__, India but have lived around the country. In 2017 I earned my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from __Bangalore__ and have been working in Bangalore since.

While in my last year of graduation, I became interested in the field of deep learning and have been working in it since. I have also worked as a graphic designer and still like doing it in my free time.

When I'm not working I like listening to music, swimming and travelling.
